## Destructuring Complex structures like Arrays and Objects.

### Examples below

Note:
- if you don't need something, you don't need to destructure it.
- Excess variables definition could impact both time and space complexity (DSA).
- we must be able to execute our program fast (with less execution time) and with less memory allocation.
